# Frontend Mentor - Contact form

![Design preview for the Contact form coding challenge](./design/desktop-preview.jpg)

## Welcome! üëã

My challenge was to build out a contact form and get it looking as close to the design as possible. I could use any tools I liked to help me complete the challenge. So if I had something I wanted to practice, I was free to give it a go.

I ensured that my users could:

- Complete the form and see a success toast message upon successful submission
- Receive form validation messages if:
- A required field has been missed
- The email address is not formatted correctly
- Complete the form only using their keyboard
- Have inputs, error messages, and the success message announced on their screen reader
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

## Overview

### The challenge

This challenge was a great opportunity for me to practice basic HTML and CSS tags. I recently updated my HTML and CSS files to apply CSS methodology (BEM).
